# BluGPT, a private and secure ChatGPT clone

> This is a fork of [microsoft/azurechat](https://github.com/microsoft/azurechat). You can find the original README file with instructions there.
**BluGPT** is a ChatGPT clone named after my cat, Blu ðŸ˜». I've slightly modified the original Microsoft project so I could host my own "ChatGPT" and share it with my family and friends.

While the original Microsoft repository might seem to enforce the use of [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service), it was actually quite simple to replace it with the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/overview). I've also replaced the GitHub and Azure AD authentication with Google, which makes it easier for my family to log in.
